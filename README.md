# Colorwise AI

**Colorwise AI** is an advanced tool designed to help you discover the perfect colors that complement your skin tone. By leveraging AI and image processing technology, Colorwise AI provides tailored color recommendations based on the tones detected in your uploaded image.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Easily upload one or multiple images for analysis.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: The app processes your image in-memory to detect skin tones without saving or storing the original files. Your images are not retained after processing.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for an optimal user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Your Image**: Select and upload your image(s). 
2. **Processing**: Our engine analyzes the image to detect your skin tone. We do not store the images permanently; they are processed in-memory.
3. **Recommendations**: Get a curated set of color recommendations tailored to complement your skin tone.
